Generate a list of unique prompts for text-to-video (T2V) generation.

Strictly adhere to the "Isolated Subject" and "Dynamic Lighting" principles defined in the system prompt. The camera should preferably be static to emphasize the lighting effect.

Follow this exact JSON structure:

{
  "t2v_prompts": [
    {
      "id": "string (e.g., t2v_001)",
      "prompt": "string (// A complete T2V prompt following the principles.)",
      "path": null
    },
    {
      "id": "string (e.g., t2v_002)",
      "prompt": "string (// Another complete T2V prompt.)",
      "path": null
    }
  ]
}
