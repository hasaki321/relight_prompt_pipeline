Generate a list of unique image sets for base generation and subsequent relighting/video tasks.

Strictly adhere to ALL principles ("Isolated background lighting", "Adherence Lighting", "Isolated Subject", "Dynamic Lighting") defined in the system prompt. The generated subject should include a 50% proportion of human portraits and a 50% proportion of items.
