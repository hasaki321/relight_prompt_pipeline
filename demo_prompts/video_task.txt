Generate a list of unique prompts for text-to-video (T2V) generation.

Strictly adhere to the "Isolated Subject" and "Dynamic Lighting" principles defined in the system prompt. The generated subject should include a 50% proportion of human portraits and a 50% proportion of items. The camera lens should have smooth movement/lens transformation to emphasize the lighting effect.

Follow this exact JSON structure:

{
  "t2v_prompts": [
    {
      "id": "string (e.g., t2v_001)",
      "prompt": "string (// A complete T2V prompt following the principles.)",
      "path": null
    },
    {
      "id": "string (e.g., t2v_002)",
      "prompt": "string (// Another complete T2V prompt.)",
      "path": null
    }
  ]
